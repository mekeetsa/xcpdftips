#  xcpdftips 

This is a LaTeX package for natbib citations with PDF tooltips.

## Manifest

The xcpdftips package contains the following files:

### xcpdftips.dtx
 
Documented source file that may be LaTeXed to get the 
detailed description and/or coding documentation.

May be docstripped with option "package,all" to get the 
`xcpdftips.sty` package file, or processed with `xcpdftips.ins`.  

### xcpdftips.ins  
 
A docstrip batch job to extract `xcpdftips.sty`
from the source file `xcpdftips.dtx`. 
Simply TeX or LaTeX this file.

This file is embedded in `xcpdftips.dtx`. If it is missing, 
then LaTeXing `xcpdftips.dtx` will extract it.
                  
## Generation

Simply run TeX or LaTeX on xcpdftips.ins, which extracts
`xcpdftips.sty` from the documented source `xcpdftips.dtx`. If 
`xcpdftips.ins` has been lost, it may be regenerated by 
running LaTeX on `xcpdftips.dtx`.

## Documentation   

Run LaTeX on `xcpdftips.dtx` or `xcpdftips.ltx`. The latter may be
edited as needed to conform to local requirements (paper
size, duplex or not, with or without entire coding).
Alternatively, a `ltxdoc.cfg` file can contain local
configurations.

For full details, print out the documentation in `xcpdftips.dtx` 
by LaTeXing it.
